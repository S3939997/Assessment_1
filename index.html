					<h3>My thoughts on these results:</h3>
					<p>I have taken these test before in the past and have found very little consistency from the expected actions or behaviors of my found traits verses the reality of my actions. Over time my results have changed and I have personally found
						very little use in the knowledge of what percentage of extroverted I am for example. This could be due to my ignorance on the topic as the dunning kruger effect has shown. However, I find that the uses for these test are either for
						psychological study by experts or individuals excuse actions or behaviors as inherent traits.</p>

				<h2>Projec Idea</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>Roll Marker: The one stop shop for marking and exporting roll data for schools. Any information that you would ever need or want about student attendance, whether you are looking for who was at school for that day, yesterday or everyday
						they have ever been in school. If you need to know student attendance, this is the product for you.</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>With over 2000 schools in Victoria, Australia alone each with possibly hundreds or even thousands of students, schools need to know where students are. In the modern age we are moving away from physical rolls and into digital rolls, this
						allows for services that can quickly analyses and export data, I see this as a perfect opportunity create a program that specializes in only rolls and attendance data.</p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Roll Marker does everything you would expect a roll marking program to do. You are able to mark the roll effectively and quickly while being able to change the roll at any time. This information would be collected and stored for future
						reference to allow school staff to see who was there on the day or class. <br> While this is the expected usage of the software you will also be able to export attendance data from individual students, classes, year levels and even the
						whole school. This information can be customized to simply show the percentage of the students attendance all the way to specifying what day students are more likely to not attend class and which reasons students are not attending class
						most often. This would be a process that is simple for anyone to pick up and find the information they need while allowing for high levels of customization of what information they need. Finally all of this information would be accessible
						from anywhere to allow for quick access of data with the rise of working from home.</p>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					<p>Hardware required would be a server that holds the data that is entered by the schools. Software requirements are programs that allow for extraction of entered data from the roll into the database and then from the database into data
						exports that are end-user friendly. Software would also need to be developed for staff to mark the roll and allow of that data to be editable after the information is entered to allow for later changes to a specific roll. Microsoft SQL
						Server and SQL Server Manager to allow for multiple schools to use the software without being able to access data from other schools.</p>
					<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>The roll marking software and the exporting data software will need to be developed. This software will need to be capable of being accessed online and be able to update the information via the roll marking software. I can see these
						skills being accessible by a software developer that specializes in web software possibly using Java Script.</p>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If this project is successful I can see the software expanding into other areas of data extraction that is required for schools, this can come in the form of staff clock in and clock out as well as visitor sign in and location tracking.
						This can create the need for additional software developers and hardware requirements as the information being collected by need to be held onsite for regulation purposes. This can cause an increase in the cost of production temporarily
						while permanently increase the upkeep cost of the data.</p>
